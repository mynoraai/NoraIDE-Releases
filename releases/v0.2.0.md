# V0.2.0

We have added a Toolcall system for Nora, which now allows it to perceive large code repositories more efficiently. Due to the use of toolcall, the usage of tokens has also been reduced significantly.

## ✨ features

1. New Handlers & Tools

> Added search_files, read_many_files, execute_command, list_files, edit_file, write_file handlers to ToolCall.

> Integrated file search, file listing, file editing, multi-file reading, and file writing capabilities.

2. UI Enhancements

> Updated ToolCall related UIs for searching files, editing files, reading files, and listing files.

> Improved approval UI for ToolCall actions.
